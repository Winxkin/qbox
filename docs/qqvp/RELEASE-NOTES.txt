Qualcomm QEMU-Virtual Platform 0.8 - Release Notes (DRAFT)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

QQVP is provided via git repositories hosted on CodeLinaro.

https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/private/qqvp/ is a link to the QQVP project
in CodeLinaro.

The user guide for QQVP is published in CreatePoint: QualcommÂ® Quick
Emulator (QEMU) Virtual Platform User Guide (80-N2040-55).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New in this release:

Bugfixes:
- Fixed issue with sdl2 on MacOS: added a SystemC display module and used
  that instead of QEMU's version on MacOS, enforcing that window
  management is performed only by the main thread.
- Fixed "libqbox: virtio: bogus descriptor or out of resources" issue
  in Red Hat Linux.
- Fixed issue that prevented OpenGL launch.
- Added workaround for issue regarding multiple qnn-net-run instances.

UX and structure changes:
- Updated repository structure:
  * libqbox, libqemu-cxx, extra-components, platforms/*, greensocs/*, have
    all been merged into the new "qbox" repository.
  * quic-vp and quic/* repositories have been merged into the new "qqvp"
    repository.
- Added --debug option and new way to specify luafiles.
- Improved qbox error messages.

Compilation:
- Made libelf and libz libraries required.
- Fixed qbox compilation warnings.

Others:
- Implemented HWKM_MASTER_CFG_KM_RNG and TCSR_SOC_EMULATION_TYPE hexagon
  register banks.
- User Guide improvements, such as corrected sdl reference version,
  adjusted example paths to new repository structure, included new
  CLI options and exiting keys, etc.

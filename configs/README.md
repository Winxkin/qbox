# conf.lua examples

SoC model files like `SA8540P_conf.lua` reference `$QQVP_IMAGE_DIR/conf.lua`
files intended for user customization.  In this directory there are some
example .lua files included for reference on how to create the user
`conf.lua` file.

The specifics of `conf.lua` contents may vary among use cases.  Host
interfaces can be enabled/disabled/overridden from these user config files.

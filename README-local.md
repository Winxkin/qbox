## LIBQBOX 

Libqbox encapsulates QEMU in SystemC such that it can be instanced as a SystemC TLM-2.0 model.

[//]: # (SECTION 10)
## Information about building and using the greensocs Qbox library
The greensocs Qbox library depends on the libraries : base-components, libgssync, libqemu-cxx, libgsutils, SystemC, RapidJSON, SystemCCI, Lua and GoogleTest.

[//]: # (SECTION 50)
##Â Instanciate Qemu
A QemuManager is required in order to instantiate a Qemu instance. A QemuManager will hold, and maintain the instance until the end of execution. The QemuInstance can contain one or many CPU's and other devices.
To create a new instance you can do this:
```c++
    QemuInstanceManager m_inst_mgr;
```

then you can initialize it by providing the QemuInstance object with the QemuInstanceManager object which will call the `new_instance` method to create a new instance.
```c++
    QemuInstance m_qemu_inst(m_inst_mgr.new_instance(QemuInstance::Target::AARCH64))
```

In order to add a CPU device to an instance they can be constructed as follows:
```c++
    sc_core::sc_vector<QemuCpuArmCortexA53> m_cpus

    m_cpus("cpu", 32, [this] (const char *n, size_t i) { return new QemuCpuArmCortexA53(n, m_qemu_inst); })
```
You can change the CPUs to those listed below in the "CPU" section

Interrupt Controllers and others devices also need a QEMU instance and can be set up as follows:
```c++
    QemuArmGicv3 m_gic("gic", m_qemu_inst);
    QemuUartPl011 m_uart("uart", m_qemu_inst)
```

## QEMU Arguments

The QEMU instance provides the following default arguments :
```
    "-M", "none", /* no machine */
    "-m", "2048", /* used by QEMU to set some interal buffer sizes */
    "-monitor", "null", /* no monitor */
    "-serial", "null", /* no serial backend */
    "-display", "none", /* no GUI */
```

QEMU arguments can be added to an entire instance using the configuration
mechanism. The instance has one parameter `args` that can be used to append a
whitespace separated list of arguments. To enable some qemu traces, one can
set `"qemu-instance-name.args" = "-D file.log -trace pattern1 -trace pattern2"`.

To append a specific QEMU option value you can also use the form
`"qemu-instance-name.args.-OPTION" = "value"`.
The latter cannot be used to append several time the same option, as a parameter definition will override any previous one.

Example :
Using the lua file configuration mechanism to set `-monitor` to enable telnet communication with QEMU, with the QEMU instance "platform.QemuInstance" the lua file should contain :

```lua
["platform.QemuInstance.args.-monitor"] = "tcp:127.0.0.1:55555,server,nowait",
```
To check that the QEMU argument has been added QEMU will report :
`Added QEMU argument: "name of the argument" "value of the argument"`

In the example it's :
`Added QEMU argument : -monitor tcp:127.0.0.1:55555,server,nowait`

Telnet can be used to connector to the monitor as follows:
```bash
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 55555
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
QEMU 5.1.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) quit
quit
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

NOTE :

This should not be used to enable GDB.

Enabling GDB per CPU
--------------------

In order to connect a GDB the CCI parameter `name.of.cpu.gdb-port` must be set a none zero value.

For instance 
```bash
$ ./build/vp --gs_luafile conf.lua -p platform.cpu_1.gdb-port=1234
```
Will open a gdb server on port 1234, for `cpu_1`, and the virtual platform will wait for GDB to connect.


## The components of libqbox
### CPU
The libqbox library supports several CPU architectures such as ARM and RISCV.
- In ARM architectures the library supports the cortex-a53 and the Neoverse-N1 which is based on the cortex-a76 architecture which itself derives from the cortex-a75/73/72.
- In RISCV architecture, the library manages only the riscv64.

### IRQ-CTRL
The library also manages interrupts by providing :
- ARM GICv2
- ARM GICv3 
which are Arm Generic Interrupt Controller.

Then :
- SiFive CLINT
- SiFive PLIC 
which are also Interrupt controller but for SiFive.

### UART
Finally, it has 2 uarts: 
- pl011 for ARM 
- 16550 for more general use

### PORTS
The library also provides socket initiators and targets for Qemu
